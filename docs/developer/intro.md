# Otto <br> Developer Guide

An open-source Wayland compositor built on Smithay with a Skia-based rendering pipeline and the laye.rs engine for scene graph/layout management.

## About this guide
This guide is written for both humans and coding agents working on Otto. 

If you are searching how to use the compositor as an end user, see the [User Guide](../) instead.


If you are an agent, start here for architecture and conceptual context, then follow the repository’s agent runbook in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for practical workflow details (build/run commands, component notes, and repo conventions).

`AGENTS.md` points back to this documentation as the long-form reference.
