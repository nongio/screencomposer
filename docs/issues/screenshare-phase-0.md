Screenshare Phase 0 â€” Scaffolding and docs

Scope
- Add feature flags: screenshare, screencopy, pipewire, headless (no behavior change by default).
- Create module stubs under src/screenshare/* and src/screencopy/*.
- Add developer docs for rendering and project structure.

Acceptance
- Build succeeds with all features off and with each feature toggled independently.
- Modules compile as stubs behind feature gates.
